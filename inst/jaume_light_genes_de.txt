The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution. Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus."	protein_coding	BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1)	BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1)

JKD can interact with the SCR and SHR proteins implicated in root patterning, as well as another zinc finger transcription factor, MAGPIE. All of these interactions require the first zinc finger in JKD according to a Y2H assay. There are also transcriptional interactions among these proteins. The initiation of JKD transcription does not appear to depend on SCR and SHR, but later expression in the post-embryonic QC cells and ground tissue initials is reduced in scr and shr mutants.

Mediates blue light-induced growth enhancements. PHOT1 and PHOT2 mediate blue light-dependent activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in guard cell protoplasts. PHOT1 undergoes blue-light-dependent autophosphorylation. At least eight phosphorylation sites have been identified in PHOT1. Phosphorylation of serine851 in the activation loop of PHOT1 appears to be required for stomatal opening, chloroplast accumulation, leaf flattening, and phototropism, and phosphorylation of serine849 may also contribute to the regulation of these responses. Phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the Hinge1 region of PHOT1 appears to require serine350 and serine376."	protein_coding	PHOTOTROPIN 1 (PHOT1)	PHOTOTROPIN 1 (PHOT1)
