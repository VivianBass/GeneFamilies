
- run script and check if it works , up until distances
-> works 

- have to check , multiple scripts doing the same
- analyse_tissues_distances.R 
- compute ExpressionProfileDistances.R 
- distances.R 
- mean median
- investigateDistributionOf...


- do we need all.cds at all ??
- would have to add Tandems to, calculate  the sim ??, need all vs all blast/Diamond
- do we need all cds ? it was used to create expressionprofils variance column ??
- need all.cds to generate , and we had the expression profile data downloaded drive 

- generateRpkmExpressionprofils script ?? already in load 

- change the sections a little bit ?? Loading, computing, plotting, t-tests etc. 

- upload to github, setup correctly
